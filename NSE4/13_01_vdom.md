# Virtual Domains

## Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)
* Logically subdevice your physical layer 2 network into smaller segments
  * Each segment forms a separate broadcast domain
  * VLAN tags added to frames to identify their network segments
* With IEEE 802.1q, a 4-byte tag extends the ethernet frame
* Layer 2 devices can add or remove tags (they cannot change the tags)
* Layer 3 devices can change (rewrite) the VLAN tags before routing
  * FortiGate is Layer 3 - that is, it can do inter-VLAN routing

## Virtual Domains (VDOMs)
* Splits a physical FortiGate into multiple virtual devices
  * With independent security policies, routing tables, and so on
* Packets confined to same VDOM
* By default, FortiGate supports up to 10 VDOMs
  * Some models allow the purchase of additional VDOMs  
  <pre>
  fw-1 # <b>config system global</b>
  fw-1 # <b>set vdom-admin enable</b></pre>
* By default, only the *root* management VDOM exists
  * Where all the global management traffic for FortiGate originates. So, it must have access to all global services that FortiGate requires
  such as: NTP, FortiGuard updates and queries 
  * Usually should have outgoing Internet access
* Inspection mode per VDOM
  * Proxy
  * Flow-based
* Operation mode per VDOM:
  * NAT
  * Transparent
* Inter-VDOM Links
  * Can connect different VDOMs
  * Supports varies by the VDOMs' operating modes
    * NAT to NAT
    * NAT to Transparent/Transparent to NAT
* Inter-VDOM links allow VDOMs to communicate
  * Traffic not required to leave a physical interface then re-enter FortiGate
  * Fewer physical interfaces/cables required
* Firewall policies are required to allow traffic from other VDOMs, same as traffic coming from physical interfaces
* Routes are also required to forward the traffic from one VDOM to another
