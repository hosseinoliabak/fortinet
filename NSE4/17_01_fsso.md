# Fortinet Single Sign-On (FSSO)

Single sign-on is a process that allows identified users access to multiple applications
* Users already identified can access without being prompted to provide credentials
  * FSSO software identify user's source IP address
  * FortiGate allows access based on user's IP address (identity-based policy)
* Each FSSO method sends login events to FortiGate differently
  * Typically used with (but no limited to) directory services (Microsoft Active Directory or Novell eDirectory)
* SSO configuration varies by directory service type:
  * Microsoft Active Directory:
    * Domain Controller agent mode
    * Polling mode
      * Collector agent-based
      * Agentless
    * TS agent mode (exclusively for Citrix and termial services environments)
      * For Citrix and Terminal Services
      * Collector agent-based
  * Novell eDirectory
    * eDirectory agent mode
    * Uses Novell API or LDAP setting

### DC Agent Mode
* The standard mode for FSSO
* Require software installed on each domain controller - DC agent
  * `dcagent.dll` installed in the `Windows\system32` directory
  * Monitors user login events
  * handle DNS lookup (by default)
* One or more collector agent installed on Windows Servers, responsible for:
  * Group verification
  * Workstation checks
  * Updates of login records on FortiGate
  * Send Domain Local Security Group, OUs, and Global Security Group information to FortiGate
* Flow
  1. User authenticates against Windows DC (with DC agent)
  2. DC agent sees login events and forwards it to collector agent (UDP 8002)
  3. Collector agent receives the event from DC agents, and forwards it to FortiGate (TCP 8000). Collector agent sends:
     * Username
     * Hostname
     * IP address
     * User group(s)
  4. ForiGate now knows who the user is, based on their IP address. The user does not need to authenticate
  
### Collector Agent-based polling mode
* Only collector agent is installed on Windows Server (No FSSO DC agent required)
* Collector agent polls each DC for user login events every few seconds
  * Uses port TCP 445 by defualt and TCP 135, TCP 139, and UDP 137 as fallback
* Event logging must be enabled on the DCs
* Less complex installation which reduces ongoing maintenance
* More CPU and memory is required by the collector agent
* Flow
  1. User authenticates against Windows DC (without DC agent)
  2. Collector agents periodically polls DCs to get user login events (TCP 445)
  3. Collector agent forwards the information to FortiGate (TCP 8000). Collector agent sends:
     * Username
     * Hostname
     * IP address
     * User group(s)
  4. ForiGate now knows who the user is, based on their IP address. The user does not need to authenticate
  
### Agentless Polling Mode
* Similar ro agent-based polling but FortiGate polls instead
* Doesn't require an external DC agent or collector agent
* Event logging must be enabled on DC
* More CPU and RAM required by FortiGate
* Support for only polling option WinSecLog
  * FortiGate uses SMB Protocol to read the event viewer logs
* Less available features than collector agent-based polling mode
* Flow
  1. FortiGate periodically polls DCs to get user login events (TCP 445)
  2. User authenticates against Windows DC (without DC agent or collector agent);
  FortiGate will discover the login event in next poll obtaining the following information:
 Collector agent sends:
     * Username
     * Hostname
     * IP address
     * User group(s)
  4. ForiGate now knows who the user is, based on their IP address. The user does not need to authenticate
  
### Currently Logged On Users:
* To show users currently logged on with FSSO
  * `diagnose debug authd fsso list`
* To manually refresh user group information
  * `exec fsso refresh`
