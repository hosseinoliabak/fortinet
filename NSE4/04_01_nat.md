# Network Address Translation (NAT)
* NAT: Changes the IP layer address of a packet
  * Source NAT (SNAT): For outgoing traffics SNAT uses the outgoing interface address or configured address pool
  * Destination NAT (DNAT): For incoming traffics DNAT uses the configured VIP as the destination address
* PAT: Changes the IP layer port number of a packet
* NAT64 and NAT46: A mechanism that allows IPv6 addressed hosts to communicate with IPv4 addressed hosts and the reverse
* NAT66: NAT between two IPv6 networks

There are 2 ways to configure source / destination NAT:
## Firewall Policy NAT
There are 2 ways to configure firewall policy SNAT:
* Using the outgoing interface (Many-to-one): NAT overload
* Using the dynamic IP pool. There are 4 types of IP pools
  * Overload (Default IP pool type)
  * One-to-one
  * Fixed port range
  * Port block allocation
  
### Virtual IPs
* Traditionally in FortiGate, VIPs are selected in the firewall policy as destination address
  * Starting in FortiGate 5.4 firmware, you can configure DNAT & VIPs for destination NAT, which is per VDOM
* DNAT objects
* Default type is static NAT: Can be restricted to forward only certain ports
* From the CLI, you can select `load-balance` or `server-load-balance`
* VIPs should be routable to the external facing (ingress) interface for the return traffic  
  
## Central NAT
* By defaults is disabled and can only be enabled through the CLI
* Must remove VIP and IP pool references from existing policies
  <pre>
  # config system settings
      set central-nat enable
    end
  </pre>
* Once enabled, these two options are available on the GUI
  * Central SNAT
    * Starting from FortiOS 5.4 SNAT is applied to VDOM and not to a specific firewall policy
    * SNAT configuration changes when central NAT is enabled (per VDOM)
      * Steps to configure:    
        * Define IP pool
        * Configure central SNAT policy
        * Enable NAT on firewall policy
  * Central DNAT & Virtual IPs
    * Enabling Central NAT changes Destination NAT configuration (per VDOM)
      * Steps to configure:
        * Define DNAT & VIPs
        * No additional configurations required
    * As soon as VIP is created, a rule is created in Kernel to allow DNAT to occur
* Central NAT is mandatory for new NGFW mode in policy-based in FortiOS 5.6
* Impacts of disabling central NAT if it was already enabled and configured for SNAT and DNAT
  * The egress-to-ingress firewall policies using the destination NAT rule will stop working
  * The ingress-to-egress firewall policies will not use IP pool for source NAT
